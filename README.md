# Portfolio Website

This was my personal portfolio website. It is designed with plain HTML, CSS and JS without a framework to learn the basics of web development. It is out of use by now and will not be updated.
You can check out my current portfolio website at [otmarkirchgaessner.com](otmarkirchgaessner.com) and the code in this [repository](https://github.com/OtmarKirch/portfolio-website-nextjs).
