# Portfolio Website

## Purpose
This is my personal portfolio website. It is designed to let you know what I have done so far as programming projects. This website itself is a project on its own and you can check out the complete code in this repository.

## Work in Progress
This website is always a work in progress. As I progess as a developer, this website and the content I present will grow with my skills.

## Hosted Website
The portfolio website will soon be hosted. Until then, you can simply clone it and run it locally on your device.
