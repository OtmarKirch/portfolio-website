    <h2>Pokedec</h2>
  <p>This simple JavaScript app was developed as a learning project to understand the principles of programming with JavaScript. By building this small web application, which utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to load data from an external API and allows for the detailed viewing of data points, the development process can be followed through the commit messages and branches of this project, providing insight into each step taken towards achieving the objective of creating a functional and interactive web application.</p>

    <h2>Meet App</h2>
  <p>This project involves building a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) using React and a test-driven development (TDD) approach. The application leverages the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events. By combining serverless and PWA concepts, the application benefits from no backend maintenance, scalability, availability, no idle time costs, instant loading, offline support, push notifications, "add to home screen" prompt, responsive design, and cross-platform compatibility. The TDD approach ensures high-quality code by writing tests before actual functionality. The application also includes data visualization through graphs, enhancing its visual appeal and data interpretation. Users can search for a city and get a list of events hosted in that city. The data visualization component includes a scatter plot showing the number of events in each location and a pie chart visualizing the popularity of event genres.</p>
