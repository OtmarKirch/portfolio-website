Hey Jennifer,

### Generating SVG
For generating the svg of my hometown I used the recraft.ai with the prompt "konstanz muenster rheinbruecke konzil imperia" and asked for a vector art image.
### Animation within SVG file
I found having the whole svg code within the html document to cumbersome. A solution was to put the styling within the svg file. I hope it is ok having it organized this way.
### Animation with the help of an AI
I added a transition for the items on "My Work" page. A screenshot is in the files folder and can also be accessed via the "CSS Skills" card on "My Work" page.
I used the code suggested by ChatGPT. The values are adjusted, so the cards rotate only a little while hovering over them.
### Unresolved issue
On my "About" page, I wanted to get rid of the margin of the first paragraph. This would align the text at the top the same as on the sides. For that, I tried to target the first child of the div. So I tried `.about-description:first-child {margin-top: 0;}`, but it didn't work. If I select the paragraph directly with an id or class, it does work. Somehow, it does not recognize the paragraph as the first child and I can't find out why.

Best regards, Otmar
